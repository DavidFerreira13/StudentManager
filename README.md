# StudentManager
2022
Console program that controls students information.

###The idea
I wanted to learn C, and since i'm currently enrolled in a C course, i thought about making a program about student management.

###The Development
I started by designing how the program should be strutured. I wanted something MVC-like but simpler so i decided on an interface, a database, and a control system.
Database:
-Have the basic CRUD operations.
-Store all the information.
Inteface:
-Interact with user
Control System:
-Make sure the rules of enrollment are applied
-Make calculations

###Tech && Methodologies
C, Visual Studio Code, Linux;
